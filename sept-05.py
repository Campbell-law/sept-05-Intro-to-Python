# Intro to Python Chapter #1

# Basic Math at the repl 
# You cans start repl on command line or in Vs-Code - shift -comand on mac then (Python_start repl)
# 1. what is the result of: 2 + 3 * 5

# play around with different math functions at repl

2 + 3 * 5

# Nothing happens if run as a file 
# run with shift-enter with curser at end of line works in interactive shell
# You need a print() function to make it show up

print(2+3*5)

# You can use a variable 

n = 2 + 3 * 5 

print(n)

# 2. assign 2,3 and 5 each to different variables then add/multiply them together in th print() function

# 3. same as 2 but assign the answer to a variable and print that

# 4. Change precedence to get 25, assign result to n2 and print answer (boring 15)

# 5. Add n to n2, assign it to ans and print ans - hint you should get 42


# 6. find the type for 2  -hint type(2)

type(2)

# 7. find type for 2.5

type(2.5)

# 8. Type for 2 + 2.5

2 + 2.5
type(2+2.5)

# Strings  -- Double quotes

"Campbell"

# concatenating Strings

"Campbell" + " " + "Law" + " " + "School"

# assign string to variable

l = "law"

# 9. print() Campbell Law School

# 10. What happens when you print() "Law" + 2019  (How can you fix it?)
