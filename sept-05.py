# Intro to Python Chapter #1

# Basic Math

2 + 3 * 5

# Nothing happens if run as a file 
# run with shift-enter with curser at end of line works in shell

n = 2 + 3 * 5 
print(n)

# or without a variable
print(2+3*5)

# Change precedence to get 25 and assign result to n2 (boring 15)

# Add n to n2, assign it to ans and print ans - hint you should get 42


# find the type for 2  -hint type(2)

type(2)

# find type foe 2.5

type(2.5)

# Type for 2 + 2.5

2 + 2.5
type(2+2.5)

#Strings

"Campbell" + " " + "Law" + " " + "School"

l = "law"
